\section{Data Structures}
    \subsection{Binary Indexed Tree}
        Also called a fenwick tree. Builds in $\bigO(n \log{n})$ from an array. Querry sum from 0 to i in $\bigO(\log{n})$ and updates an element in $\bigO(\log{n})$.
        \code{DS/BIT.java}
    \subsection{Segment Tree}
        More general than a fenwick tree. Can adapt other operations than sum, e.g.\ min and max.
        \code{DS/ST.java}
    \subsection{Lazy Segment Tree}
        More general implementation of a segment tree where its possible to increase whole segments by some diff, with lazy propagation. Implemented with arrays instead of nodes, which probably has less overhead to write during a competition.
        \code{DS/LazySegmentTree.java}
    \subsection{Union Find}
        This data structure is used in varoius algorithms, for example Kruskals algorithm for finding a Minimal Spanning Tree in a weighted graph. Also it can be used for backward simulation of dividing a set.
        \code{DS/UF.java}
    \subsection{Monotone Queue}
        Used in sliding window algorithms where one would like to find the minimum in each interval of a given length. Amortized $\bigO(n)$ to find min in each of these intervals in an array of length $n$. Can easily be used to find the maximum as well.
        \code{DS/MinMonQue.java}
    \subsection{Treap}
        Treap is a binary search tree that uses randomization to balance itself. 
        It's easy to implement, and gives you access to the internal structures of a binary tree, 
        which can be used to find the k'th element for example. Because of the randomness, the average height is about a factor 4 of a prefectly balanced tree.
        \code{DS/Treap.java}
\section{Graph Algorithms}
    \subsection{Djikstras algorithm}
        Finds the shortest distance between two Nodes in a weighted graph in $\bigO (|E| \log{|V|})$ time.
        \code{Graphs/Djikstra.java}
    \subsection{Bipartite Graphs}
        The Hopcroft-Karp algorithm finds the maximal matching in a bipartite graph. Also, this matching can together with KÃ¶nings theorem be used to construct a minimal vertex-cover, which as we all know is the complement of a maximum independent set. Runs in $\bigO (|E|\sqrt{|V|})$. 
        \code{Graphs/BiGraph.java}
    \subsection{Network Flow}
        The Floyd Warshall algorithm for determining the maximum flow through a graph can be used for a lot of unexpected problems. Given a problem that can be formulated as a graph, where no ideas are found trying, it might help trying to apply network flow. The running time is $\bigO (C \cdot m)$ where $C$ is the maximum flow and $m$ is the amount of edges in the graph. 
        If $C$ is very large we can change the running time to $\bigO (\log{C}m^2)$ by only studying edges with a large enough capacity in the beginning.
        \code{Graphs/NetworkFlow.java}
    \subsection{Min Cost Max Flow}
        Finds the minimal cost of a maximum flow through a graph. 
        Can be used for some optimization problems where the optimal assignment needs to be a maximum flow.
        \code{Graphs/MinCostMaxFlow.java}

\section{Dynamic Programming}
    \subsection{Longest Increasing Subsequence}
        Finds the longest increasing subsequence in an array in $\bigO(n \log{n})$ time. Can easility be transformed to longest decreasing/nondecreasing/nonincreasing subsequence.
        \code{DP/lis.java}
    \subsection{String functions}
        The z-function computes the longest common prefix of $t$ and $t[i:]$ for each $i$ in $\bigO(|t|)$.
        The border function computes the longest common proper (smaller than whole string) prefix and suffix of string $t[:i]$.
        \code{DP/strings.py}

\section{Etc}
    \subsection{System of Equations}
        Solves the system of equations $\bm{A}\bm{x} = \bm{b}$ by Gaussian elimination. This can for example be used to determine the expected value of each node in a markov chain. Runns in $\bigO (N^3)$.
        \code{Etc/SolveSystem.java}
    \subsection{Convex Hull}
        From a collection of points in the plane the convex hull is often used to compute the largest distance or the area covered, or the length of a rope that encloses the points. It can be found in $\bigO (N\log{N})$ time by sorting the points on angle and the sweeping over all of them.
        \code{Etc/ConvexHull.java}
    \subsection{Number Theory}
        \code{Etc/numbertheory.py}

\section{NP tricks}
    \subsection{MaxClique}
        The max clique problem is one of Karp's 21 NP-complete problems. The problem is to find the lagest subset of an undirected graph that forms a clique - a complete graph. There is an obvious algorithm that just inspects every subset of the graph and determines if this subset is a clique. This algorithm runns in $\bigO(n^22^n)$. However one can use the meet in the middle trick (one step divide and conqurer) and reduce the complexity to $\bigO(n^22^{\frac{n}{2}})$.
        \code{NP/MaxClique.java}
\section{Coordinate Geometry}
    \subsection{Area of a nonintersecting polygon}
        The signed area of a polygon with n verticies is given by 
        $$A = \frac{1}{2}\sum_{i=0}^{n-1}(x_iy_{i+1} - x_{i+1}y_i)$$
    \subsection{Intersection of two lines}
        Two lines defined by 
        \begin{align*}
            a_1x + b_1y + c_1 &= 0 \\
            a_2x + b_2y + c_2 &= 0 
        \end{align*}
        Intersects in the point 
        $$P = (\frac{b_1c_2 - b_2c_1}{w}, \frac{a_2c_1 - a_1c_2}{w}),$$
        where $w = a_1b_2 - a_2b_1$. If $w = 0$ the lines are parallell.
        \subsection{Distance between line segment and point}
        Given a linesegment between point $P, Q$, the distance D to point $R$ is given by:
        \begin{align*}
            a &= Q_y - P_y \\
            b &= Q_x - P_x \\
            c &= P_xQ_y - P_yQ_x \\
            R_P &= (\frac{b(bR_x - aR_y) - ac}{a^2 + b^2}, \frac{a(aR_y - bR_x) - bc}{a^2 + b^2}) \\
            D &= 
            \begin{cases}
                \frac{|aR_x + bR_y + c|}{\sqrt{a^2 + b^2}} & \text{if $(R_{P_x}- P_x)(R_{P_x} - Q_x) < 0$}, \\
                \min{|P - R|, |Q - R|} & \text{otherwise}
            \end{cases}
        \end{align*}
    \subsection{Picks theorem}
        Find the amount of internal integer coordinates $i$ inside a polygon with picks theorem
        $A = \frac{b}{2} + i - 1$, where $A$ is the area of the polygon and 
        $b$ is the amount of coordinates on the boundary.
